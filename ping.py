'''
Two Scapy functions related to sending and receiving packets are the srloop() and srploop().

srloop() will send packets from layer 3 and continue to resend the packet after each response is received.
srploop() does the same thing except forâ€¦ it sends the packets from layer 2 (you can modify you MAC Address)
count()	defines the number of times you want to loop.
